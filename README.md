Hello! My name is skyler reuben, and this is the repository for my website. THis project is something i have wanted to do for a while, but never found the right platform to do it on. 

In my website, you will find many different finsihed pages, and many many many unfinished pages. Among the finished are notes for classes, style and finance logs, essays, and life guidelines, and among the unfinished are xcode projects, conlanguages, and interactive, java-incorperated to-do lists.

If a unique viewer happens upon my website and sees room for improvement in any aspect, whether a simple grammatical error or an entire redesign concept, please please contact me! I appreciate any feedback you have (but please dont tell me i dont capitalize my I's. I know this, i do it intentionally most of the time)!
