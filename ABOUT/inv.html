<ol start="1"><li>Ordinary world - Edward in tower
</li><li>Call to adventure - Peg finds him
</li><li>Refusal - no clear refusal, but just being unsure of coming down to town with Peggy.
</li><li>Meeting the mentor - also with meeting Peg, this is when he meets all the characters at the barbecue and the dad.
</li><li>Crossing the threshold - after the barbecue, seeming to get into the lives of the ordinary, when Wynona and her boyfriend show up.
</li><li>Test, Allies, Enemies - we see him envious and angry at her boyfriend, and also see the crazy religious lady who keeps trying to convince everyone he’s the devil. He is tested in various ways through hanging out with all the different people, getting “jobs” like gardening and haircutting, etc.
</li><li> Approach to the Inmost cave - the buildup of Kim and His relationship through the TV scene were we see her defending him, and then the small interaction of unlocking the door for her boyfriend leads him to discuss with Kim ways to take advantage of Edward.
</li><li> Ordeal - many of these. The first one being Joyce trying to make a move on him and being rejected, but the big one being robbing the house. This causes everyone to think differently of him because he is blamed entirely for the robbery. Another prominent one is where he accidentally scratches Kim’s face, among many others, and the final ordeal being him trying to save Kevin but ending up looking like Edward attacked him.
</li><li>Seizing the reward - finally being able to embrace Kim and her breaking up with her boyfriend.
</li><li>The Road back - him running away back to his home for safety, and the cop trying to stop the mob from following him so he can be safe for good.
</li><li>Resurrection - when Jim and Edward have a fight at Edward’s house.
</li><li>Return with Elixir - once Jim is dead, Kim defends him, and everything is how safe and they still have each other’s hearts.

		<h1>FILM | A HERO’S JOURNEY</h1>
<ol start="1"><li><b>Ordinary world</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	 The starting point of a journey, showing off the world before the main event of the movie. This is a character building experience.</p>
<p>	An example of this is in the movie Harry Potter. Harry Potter lives under the stairs when we first see him. We learn a lot about what he’s been used to and where he’s been with his life.</p>
<ol start="2"><li><b>Call to adventure</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	This is the part where things start branching from the ordinary world, and the hero receives information or is sent out to start the journey. </p>
<p>	In Harry Potter, this is when Hagrid breaks into their house and tells Harry “you’re a Wizard, Harry.” We see that this is a turning point, as up until then, not only did he not know he was a wizard, but after this, a whole new world for Harry.</p>
<ol start="4"><li><b>Refusal</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	Refusal  is the stage before they actually accept the call, where they seem unsure and may suffer because of it. </p>
<p>	The refusal in Harry Potter is very short, and it’s basically just the back and forth between Harry and Hagrid when Harry doesn’t believe he is a wizard while Hagrid tries to prove that he is. </p>
<ol start="5"><li><b>Meeting with the Mentor</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	In this part of a story, the role model or mentor is found by or for the hero and is taught how to survive this new world.</p>
<p>	This section of the story in Harry Potter goes almost in line with the Call to Adventure, in that Hagrid and the teachers (semi-into act II though)  are the mentors he has throughout the story. This is shown more obviously that Hagrid is his mentor when Hagrid takes him to Diagon Ally. </p>
<ol start="6"><li><b>Crossing the Threshold</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	This is the part in which the transition into the non-ordinary world really shows its true colors. In other words, when they truly begin their quest or purpose. </p>
<p>	In Harry Potter, this is when Harry learns about his parents and Voldemort. </p>
<ol start="7"><li><b>Tests, Allies, Enemies</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	When the character is out of their comfort zone, this is where they meet their allies and enemies. They may go through various tests, sometimes seen as a montage of skill building or traveling a path where various enemies jump out and try to attack in a video game per-say, where the Hero always triumphs, but may struggle.</p>
<p>	The test montage of Harry trying, sometimes failing and sometimes succeeding in his classes, and the broomstick flying to catch the golden snitch, then getting into a little trouble, this is all under the testing category. Meeting Ron and Hermione is part of the allies category, and meeting Snape and hearing about Voldemort is under the enemies category.</p>
<ol start="8"><li><b>Approach to Inmost cave</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	The approach to the Inmost cave is the point in which you can see the outline of the final result, or the possibility of, as opposed to before this moment, where it was a journey adjusting to the new life and preparing for this moment in act II. </p>
<p>	In Harry Potter, this is the moment where the plan to get the Philosopher’s Stone before Snape does.</p>
<ol start="9"><li><b>Ordeal</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	The ordeal is where one big event happens that allows them to advance into the final stages of the plot. This may also result in the possession or completion of reward, only to have it be taken back or away or revoked in some way during the real final stage; a sike-out.</p>
<p>	When Harry and his friends overcome the obstacles set to protect the Philosopher’s stone and fine the room.</p>
<ol start="10"><li><b>Reward</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	The reward is then the Hero gets their hands on the main goal. Either this, or it is within their reach and they are about to have this.</p>
<p>	In Harry Potter, this is when Harry enters the room where the Philosopher’s stone is hidden.</p>
<ol start="11"><li><b>The Road Back</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	The road back is when the Hero tries to return back to the ordinary world, but faces the beginnings of the greatest challenge in the movie or plot.. Its acts like a reverse Call to Action </p>
<p>	In Harry Potter, this is when Harry encounters professor Quarrel, and really meets Voldemort.</p>
<ol start="12"><li><b>Resurrection</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	Resurrection is the stage either in which the real final challenge happens, or the ending of it, where the final death happens, final (pun intended) resurrection happens, or where the clarification of the ending happens.</p>
<p>In Harry Potter, the latter happens, when harry wakes up in the hospital and has the ending and the reason for it explained to him.</p>
<ol start="13"><li><b>Return with Elixir</b>
</li></ol>
<p>	This is a fancy way of saying everything is back to normal, but better. The character changes, the original world is in a better state, or something is cured. </p>
<p>	In Harry Potter, this is when he finally returns back home, but happy to belong to Hogwarts too.</p>
